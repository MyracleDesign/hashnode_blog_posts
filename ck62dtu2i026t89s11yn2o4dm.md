## 31 Flutter Videos in 31 Days

I start with a new challenge, I always wanted to have a successful youtube channel but never had the time or the encouragement. Today I announced that I want to participate in the 31Videos31Days challenge on Twitter.

It will be a tough time but I already made it to record 10 videos in a row, and now I will fully commit to the goal of 31 videos. All videos will have Flutter related information from basic stuff like what is a widget to more complicated information like how to make a network request.

If you are interested in in how my journey goes, I will give small and short updates once in a while here on Hashnode.
